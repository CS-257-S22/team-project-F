# H-1B Employer Data Hub
H-1B Visa is a nonimmigrant visa that allows U.S. employers to hire foreigners for jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or equivalent. We aim to create a project that acts as a data hub of H-1B statistics from 2018 to 2022. The project will provide a clear presentation of data and helpful features to aid the user!
 
# Dataset
For this project, we will use CSV files that contain the relevant records of H-1B Visa for numerous companies that apply on behalf of non-US citizens in the United States. The CSV file is arranged by fiscal year, employer name, initial approval, initial denial, continuing approval, continuing denial, NAICS (North American Industry Classification System Code), Tax ID, State, City, and ZIP. The link below is the link we used to download all the files and find descriptions of the dataset.

We will be using data files from 2018 to 2022 to have more options and diversity in our project. 
The provider of this data is the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It updated its data last on January 8th, 2021. The data posted on US government websites are automatically published under an open license, so there are no terms of use. 
 
# User Interaction
Some interesting and meaningful ways that a user could interact with the data are:
 
- The user can select a state and see the list of all companies in that state.
- The user can search a company’s name and see all the relevant statistics. 
- The user can see the top 10 companies with the highest percentage of visa approval. 
- The user can search for companies with the minimum number of approvals whether it is initial or continuing. 
 
These functions of our project will be useful in addition to the organized display of data. 

 
# Team Contract

The goal of our team is to show good collaboration and communication as a team. We want to gain and improve our programming skills, both frontend, and backend, and understand the agile development process. 

Each team member has his or her strengths that we are confident in bringing to the project. Joshua is an excellent listener and has good time management skills. He is also confident in finding answers to problems very efficiently through wide online searches. Sunny is responsible for the work she is assigned and is a good communicator. Bennet is also an excellent communicator and he has some experience with HTML and CSS, which will be a valuable asset to our project. Yeabsira has a solid background in programming and manipulating Unix terminals which will be helpful in any step of the project. 

We will try to rotate roles between frontend, backend, data, UI/Design, communicator, and reviewer. We thought a rotation system would be the fairest and most effective way because this way, we could split the workload equally throughout the term. Also, we can help each other out when we get stuck, and help each other develop skills in all roles. 

Our team will use slack to communicate with each other to choose a meeting time or whenever we need to talk to each other. We aim to meet at least once a week. We will make sure to use respectful language when communicating, and tag each other when addressing the teammate. We should make sure to check slack once a day if there is a notification and tag each other if the teammates do not answer. For online meetings, we will use Zoom. For documentation and code work, we would be using Google Docs and Github. Decisions will be made by either consensus or majority rule, where a bigger say would go to the person with the assigned role related to the decision. We would make sure to finish and deliver good quality work that meets the criteria within the set time. Teammates will help each other by pair programming whenever someone does not live up to their responsibilities or does not meet the standards for work set by the team. We will review the code constantly to make sure nobody is falling behind. 

# Divisions of Responsibilities

-	Yeabsira will be responsible for designing and programming the functions that execute the independent features of our final project. He is also responsible for writing the Usage statement and Readme of the project.

-	Joshua is responsible for designing and programming the helper functions that are heavily used by our independent features and he is also responsible for designing the Object-Oriented structure of the program.

-	Sunny is responsible for designing and programming the data parser and verification of user input and command line arguments.

-	Bennet is responsible for designing and programming additional independent features. He is also responsible for the HTML/CSS of our website.

-	Test Suites and writing of the proposal are a shared responsibility of all team members.
