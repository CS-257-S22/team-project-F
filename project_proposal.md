# H-1B Employer Data Hub
H-1B Visa is a nonimmigrant visa that allows U.S. employers to hire foreigners for jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or equivalent. We aim to create a project that acts as a data hub of H-1B statistics from 2018 to 2022. The project will provide a clear presentation of data and helpful features to aid the user!
 
# Dataset
For this project, we will use CSV files that contain the relevant records of H-1B Visa for numerous companies that apply on behalf of non-US citizens in the United States. The CSV file is arranged by fiscal year, employer name, initial approval, initial denial, continuing approval, continuing denial, NAICS (North American Industry Classification System Code), Tax ID, State, City, and ZIP. The link below can be  used to download all the files and find descriptions of the dataset.

We will be using data files from 2018 to 2022 to have more options and diversity in our project. 
The provider of this data is the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The dataset updated its entries last on January 8th, 2021. The data posted on US government websites are automatically published under an open license, so there are no terms of use. 
 
# User Interaction
Some interesting and meaningful ways that a user could interact with the data are:
 
- The user can select a state and see the list of all companies in that state.
- The user can search a company’s name and see all the relevant statistics. 
- The user can see the top 10 companies with the highest percentage of visa approval. 
- The user can search for companies with the minimum number of approvals whether it is initial or continuing. 
 
These functions of our project will be useful in addition to the organized display of data. 

 
# Team Contract

## Goal

- Improve the team skills of our members which include but are not limited to communication,
  scheduling, division of task, and collaboration.

- Enhance our backend and frontend programming skills and practises by learning from each other

- Learn the effective usage of Git in organizing our team projects

- Learn new frameworks that are utilized in database and website systems

- Delivering a relevant and refined final project for our class


## Strength of our members

Each team member has his or her strengths that we are confident in bringing to the project.

- Joshua is an excellent listener and has good time management skills. He is also confident in     finding answers to problems very efficiently through wide online researches. He also has a good understanding of Python and Object Oriented Programming which is helpful for our projects. Joshua also has an excellent understanding of Github.

- Sunny is responsible for the work she is assigned and is a good communicator. She is also familiar with Python. She also have a good understanding of user interfaces and data management.

- Bennet is also an excellent communicator and he has some experience with HTML and CSS, which will be a valuable asset to our project.

# Capitalising on our individual strength

Each team member haa a unique experience and background to programming which will allow us to learn different programming techniques and practises from one another. Some member are generally more good at communication than others which provides ground for us to improve our team skills through the extensive interaction we have in building and discussing projects. Joshua knowledge about Github will allow other members to readily learn about the inner workings of this system for facilitating our team projects. Finally, the diversity of skills and attributes that exist within out team will allow us to deliver a quality final project.


# Team Meetings

## Time and place
- Regular team meeting takes place once a week at Saturday 11:30 AM.

  an appropriate time

- There is also a mandatory meeting in the due date of any group deliverable to discuss final touches of our project. The time will be chosen at the previous meeting

All meetings takes place in person at Olin 3rd Computer Labs

## Roles during team meetings:

Yeabsira - Agenda Setter

Bennet - Facilitator

Sunny - Discussion Leader

Joshua - Note Taker

# Means of Communication

## App
Slack is used our primary mean of communication. A group has been created by Joshuan and each member can post in different channels and respond to other team members

- Each team member is required to make a relevant post or reply atleast once a week.

 Team members that are not abiding by the above rules will be subject to questioning during the next meeting of the group

 # Facilitating Technologies

 - Visual Studios will be our primary IDE when undertaking a programming task

 - Slack will be used as our team communication app

 - Github will be used to host and manage all our projects

 - Google Docs serves as the word processor when writing and discussing documents such as this proposal

 - All other tools, programming languages, and frameworks will be utilized as per the requirments of our group deliverable and subsequent meetings we have as a team.

 # Decision Making

 - All decision making is done through voting and a minimum of 3 out of 4 votes is needed to enact a decision.

 - In the case of tie(2/2), each duo will present why there decision is right and voting is done again until we reach that minimum 3 out 4 vote. This goes on until a magority vote is acheived.
